**Issues**

1. Redirecting is indiscriminate whether registered or not
2. Modal is persistent despite having tokens logged and stored in cookies
3. Activity is hindered by modal being improperly implemented

**Fixes for Next Session**

1. Fix the modal from the very root of the cause
2. Remake the interaction if need be
3. Put aside the modal and focus on making dummy data and fetching it to the front end
4. Fully flesh out the backend along with routes and services
5. Create the friend system and the 1:1 chat between friends using websockets
6. Flush out the recipe detail page and profile pages asap
